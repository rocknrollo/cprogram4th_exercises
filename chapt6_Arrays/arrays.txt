defining an arrays

an array is not a single value but a set of values.
each element in the set can be referenced by means of an index number or subscript.
eg grades[5] - refers to element number 5 in array grades

arrays are zero indexed so grades[0] is the first element in grades therefore grades[5]
is actually the 6th element.

assigning an array; grades[5] = 50; array named grades at element 5 has a value of 50.
