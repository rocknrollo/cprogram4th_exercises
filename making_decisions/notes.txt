computer program relies on its ability to make decisions. 

3 decision points to learn
if statements
the switch statement 
conditional operator

if statement

if (expression)
    program statement

if expression is met program statment is run

if-else construct

if (expression)

    program statement 1
else
    program statement2

only one of the statements can be evaluated not both

compound rational tests

and or operators
&& ||

else if statements and nested if statements

if ( expression 1 )
program statement 1
else if ( expression 2 )
program statement 2
else
program statement 3

Switch statement

switch (expression)
{
    case value1:
        program statement
        program statement
            ...
        break;
    case value2:
        program statement
        program statement
            ...
        break;
    case valuen:
        program statement
        program statement
            ...
        break;
    default:
        program statement
        program statement
            ...
        break;    
}

prime numbers program 5_10

the value of p is initially 2;
if p less then or equal to 50 isprime = 1;
and the for loop is also executed.

d = 2 if d is less then p and the p%d ==0 isprime =0

if is prime is not 0 print the value of p.
